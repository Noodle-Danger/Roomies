# R.O.S.I.E. â€“ Routine Optimization & Scheduling Intelligent Engine

## About
R.O.S.I.E. is a web application that leverages AI to help roommates manage chores in a shared living space. Traditional methods of chore assignment often result in mutiny or resentment, creating a negative atmosphere among roommates. 

R.O.S.I.E. addresses this common problem by introducing a light-hearted, gamified approach to chore management. By allowing users to outsource chore assignments to AI, we transform completing mundane tasks into a fun and engaging community effort. Completing chores is rewarded with a token economy that can be used to redeem perks. Now the challenge becomes claiming the perks before your roommates do!

## Overview
The challenge with managing chores in a shared living environment is that it can be difficult to get everyone to do their fair share.

This app takes a light-hearted and friendly approach to this problem by gamifying the process:
Each roommate in a shared household can:
- query AI to generate a random chore and store its custom image in a shared database
- create a chore that need to be done and assign that chore a reward token value
- see all the chores that are available to be done/claimed
- complete chores to claim tokens
- spend tokens to claim prized perks 

- create perks that can be claimed and assign the perk a redeem value
- see all the perks that are available to be claimed
- claim a perk with available tokens

## Future Enhancements
- leverage AI to randomly assign chores to roommates and generate required sub-tasks for each chore to ensure consistency & completion
- user can auction off assigned chores for greater token value to other roommates
- other roommates can bid on the chores and accept the due date terms and the original assignee can accept the lowest bidder
- user can forfeit a perk to refill balance 
- leverage AI to generate rare bonus chores/perks for bonus tokens
